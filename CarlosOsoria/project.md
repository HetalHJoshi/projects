# Music Store Project 

## Project Overview 

My project is a music store where users can come to purchase their most beloved audio tracks or album. To purchase albums or individual tracks users will need to create an account and login because all product on the store are .mp3 files which the user can download anytime to their computers or phones. 

Upon purchase the system will send to the user an email with a verified unique link they can use for 3 days to download their purchased track or album. All downloads will be offered on a compressed .zip file for convience. 

Users can comeback to the website login and under the account section they will be able to find all previously purchased items and download them again.
